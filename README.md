## Motivation
![Motivation (picture)](https://strangecart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/m4.jpg)

Our team members have both been part programming course as a student, teaching assistant. This leads us later to an idea to make learning programming more fun and interactive. Our motivation is to create a platform or software where we help people to learn in creative ways. The goals are to make learning more fun and interactive, and our idea to create a platform where people can use games to teach and learn new things. We intend to gamify the way people pass away knowledge and make it more fun, interactive, and creative through different games.

## The Developers
The initial developers of this project consist of 3 students studying at the University of Agder partaking in a course about Open Source Software development.
